## July 2

- Terratest, a library to write automated tests for your Infrastructure as Code https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest
- How to refactor a public interface… or maybe it's the wrong question to ask. A topic on the abuse of the word "refactoring" and what is actually "refactor" vs. "redesign". https://medium.com/@fagnerbrack/how-to-refactor-a-public-interface-317ed18d38a3
- As promised, the talk from JBrains on "The Economics of Software Design". It's a very good resource to understand why do we test/refactor/… and how to explain this to other people, including non-technical ones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY
- A (short) talk from GeePaw Hill to talk about TDD and "the lump of coding fallacy". I like this one because it adresses the point "we don't have time to do TDD, we have a deadline to meet". You can replace "TDD" with "tests" in general, if that's your situation (as we discussed yesterday). http://geepawhill.org/tdd-and-the-lump-of-coding-fallacy/
